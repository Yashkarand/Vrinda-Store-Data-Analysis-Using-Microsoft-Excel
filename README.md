## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Before dashboard creation, the raw dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and quality:

### ✅ Data Cleaning Tasks:
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries.
- Standardized inconsistent text formats (e.g., Month, Channel names).
- Converted text-based dates into Excel-readable `Date` format.
- Removed rows with missing `Order ID`, `Amount`, or `Status`.

### 🔄 Data Preprocessing:
- Created a new **Age Group** column (Teenager, Adult, Senior).
- Extracted **Month** from the `Date` column using Excel functions.
- Classified **Sales Channels** and **Product Categories**.
- Converted numerical fields (e.g., Amount) to proper currency format.
- Built **Pivot Tables** for summarizing key metrics.
- Added **Slicers** for easy filtering and interaction.
